# Course Material

I’ve compiled question papers for ECE, CSX core courses, electives I’ve taken, as well as some papers sourced from other contributors. You’ll also find papers for common courses like DSA, Linear Algebra, and a few CS courses.<br>

For a full overview of all the available papers, please check the course tree in the README.<br>

**`Note:`**  I’ve tried my best to collect as many papers as possible. If something is missing, it’s likely because that exam was worksheet-based and I couldn’t retrieve the questions.<br>
